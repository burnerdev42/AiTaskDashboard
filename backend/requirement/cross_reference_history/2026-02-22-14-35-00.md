# Master Cross-Reference Sync Report

**Date:** 2026-02-22 14:35:00

## Executive Summary
A full pipeline synchronization check was performed across all Data Requirements, DB Schemas, API Swagger documentation, API Implementation Specifications, and Backend source code (including tests) by the `MASTER_BACKEND_AGENT`. This was a self-healing loop verification check.

## Step 1: SCHEMA_AGENT
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Findings**: `Data requirements.txt` mapping perfectly to Mongoose Model specifications (`spec/db_models/`), Mongoose Schemas (`schema/`), and generated Sample JSON (`sample_data/`). No schema drifts were identified.

## Step 2: SWAGGER_AGENT
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Findings**: Swagger YAML endpoints and definitions strictly conform to the 12 explicit Notification Types declared in `Data requirements.txt`. No old references (such as `challenge_downvoted`) exist.

## Step 3: API_SPEC_AGENT
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Findings**: The business logic defined inside the `spec/api_impl/` directory remains strictly synced with Swagger and `Data requirements.txt`.

## Step 4: BACKEND_CODER_AGENT
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Findings**: 
  - Verified `src/common/constants/app-constants.ts` accurately maps all domain arrays (15 Activity Types, 12 Notification Types) from `Data requirements.txt`. It reflects the correct states with no drift.
  - The core domain services (`ChallengesService`, `IdeasService`, `CommentsService`, `NotificationsService`) and controllers match the implementation specifications seamlessly.
  - **Tests**: Ran total `110` tests across 25 suites using Jest. **All 110 tests passed.**
  - **Build**: Successfully compiled using `nest build`.

## Step 5: README_AGENT
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Findings**: The backend `README.md` document perfectly reflects the current state of Data Models, Enums, and API Endpoints. No out-of-sync types or missing models were detected.

## Conclusion
The backend ecosystem remains fully synchronized. The self-healing loop detected **no outstanding drifts**. The backend is perfectly aligned with the source-of-truth documentation across all 6 steps of the pipeline.
